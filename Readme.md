## Recruitment tasks

I've summed up my soluton within two main parts - client (for displaying text input inside the console) and s3, where you can find Amazon Bucket connector and api functions for managing it's state. I tried to keep it as tidy and simple as possible, hence I've used quite a long time at the beginning inspecting how I can organise my code. If I were to develop this CLI further, I'd write unit tests and handle all possible errors in informative way. 

Thank you for this opportunity! 

With kind regards, 
Filip
